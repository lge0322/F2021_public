  - An individual term project based on Python

  - Final grade: 93.7

  - Algorithm complexity:
  
    -> random map generation (breadth-first search, every game will have different settings of the maze and the locations of obstacles)
    -> random level generation
    -> random obstacle implementations
    -> pathfinding hint solutions
    -> Pygame module
  
  - Possible Improvement:
  
    -> Implementing an AI player
