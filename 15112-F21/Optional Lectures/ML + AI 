- Machine learning (subclass of AI)
    - Classification
    - Regression
    - Unsupervised learning
    - Computer vision
    - Deep learning

    1. Training data

#First ML Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors

#Intuition: Similar inputs give similar outputs
#Data represented by a vector of features (numbers)
#Get the k-closest data points to an input, and vote for the result!

def predict(X, D):
    k = 5
    closest = getKClosest(X, D, k)
    mostLikelyClass = getMajorityClass(closest)
    return mostLikelyClass
