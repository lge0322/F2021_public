      <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language (as opposed to a 
        programming langauge). Its purpose is to design documents that will be 
        rendered by a web browser as a web page, like this one! Every component 
        on this page (the navigation bars, the header text, the GIF to the right, 
        this text) is all contained within various tags. Consider the HTML code below:
      </p>
      
      <pre>
      <code>
        &ltp&gtThis is &ltb&gtSO COOL!&ltb&gt&lt/p&gt
        &lta href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gtThis is a link&lt/a&gt
      </code>
      </pre>

      <p>There are 3 tags inside of that snippet: 
        <ul>
          <li>The p tag represents a paragraph. Text is usually stored inside of these.</li>
          <li>The b tag means that whatever text is inside of this tag will be bolded.</li>
          <li>The a tag is a link to another web page (or another location within this page. 
              This tag also has an attribute called href. Each tag can have a bunch of attributes.
              In this case, the value of the href attribute indicates where the link should go 
              to when clicked.</li>
        </ul>
      The list above was written inside of an ul tag (short for unordered list). 
      Each element of that list was written inside of an li tag (short for list element).
      </p>
      <p>
      Circling back: suppose we actually wrote the html code snippet above into a web page. 
      We would see the two lines directly below:
      </p>

        <p>This is <b>SO COOL!</b></p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">This is a link</a>

      <p>
      Now writing an entire web page using just HTML would be tedious and ugly. 
      HTML is often paired with 2 other languages: CSS and JS.
      </p>

      <p>
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to describe what HTML elements should look like.
      CSS stylesheets are usually imported into an HTML document at the top. They contain
      specifications for how specific tags, classes, or IDs should be stylized.
      Below are two snippets of CSS code. The first specifies that all p tags should use the font
      Lucida Console, and the second specifies all tags with a class attribute of "swag" should have
      white text and a blue background. 
      </p>  
      <pre>
      <code>
        p {
          font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;
        }

        .swag {
          background-color: blue;
          color: white;
        }
      </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
      In fact, in order to display the CSS code shown above, an html code tag was
      used. This code tag had been stylized by CSS so that it would have a background 
      color of #f5f5f5 (very light grey), text font of courier, and several other properties.
      </p>

      <p>
      CSS can control basically anything about how your page elements should look, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Font family, weight, size, color</li>
        <li>Element width, height, text alignment, margins, padding</li>
        <li>Borders, background colors/images</li>
        <li>What bullet points should lists use</li>
        <li>How should elements move/resize when the page resizes</li>
        <li>How elements appearences should change when hoverd/clicked on</li>
        <li>Table borders, cell dimensions, cell color</li>
        <li>A bunch of even more interesting things</li>
      </ul>
      It is common practice for websites to either start out as a downloaded HTML/CSS template
      with the styling pre-written, or to import CSS from a library online, or both. In fact,
      this page was written with a template that imported TONS of CSS. If a lines 8-28 of
      this HTML file are commented out, you can see what this page looks like without the CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
      JS (short for JavaScript) is a language much closer to Python. Some of its syntax looks
      C/C++-esque, but most of its features are extremely similar to Python. Python is better
      for writing large programs, but JS is better for web development because it is so
      easily integrated with HTML. The way this is often phrased in industry is that Python
      is often used for back-end development (everything that users don't see) and Javascript
      is often used for front-end development (everything that they do see).
      </p>

      <p>
        The rest of this website is dedicated to demonstrating some of JS's features and functionality,
        including its interactions with HTML code. Click on the 7 links on the navigation bar on the
        top of this page to see these examples in action.
